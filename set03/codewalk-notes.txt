Question 1 :-

Design Grade:- AB
TA Comments on Design:-
	1. Wrong constructor template for Doodad (should use make-doodad rather than define-struct)
	2. Redundant type in interpretation for Doodad
	3. Defined doodad-color as type of String 
		1) Should have a more secific interpretation and specific where clauses in related functions, otherwise we can pass any string e.g. "abc"
		2) Or define itemization Data for doodad-color
		3) Or use the Racket built in data type Corlor 
	4. Should follow one function one task design recipe (e.g. function: check-x)
